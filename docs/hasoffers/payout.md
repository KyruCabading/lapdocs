# Payout
There is a minimum `$25 dollar` threshold per payout which happens every month. When you accumulate more than $25 in approved conversions an invoice is automatically generated which will be available to you to view in your Hasoffers account. Payout of this invoice will be within ```30 days``` from when it is generated.
